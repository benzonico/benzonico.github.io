I switched of ide recently. Let me tell you the story of that journey... 

I am a children of Eclipse. I grew up as a Java developer with Eclipse. My first contact with Java was at school and teachers made us Emacs at first but quickly moved us to Eclipse. And I have been using it since then : so that has been 10 years now... (I did not count years before writing them down : I feel old now). 

A few weeks ago I was assigned the task to implement the support of Java 8 in SonarQube (this will probably lead to the writing of some other posts). And the first task to complete this is to fiddle around with the language to see what you can do.
