So here it is, I have finally decided to open a blog. This not something I want to be totally original but I think I can share some experiences and force myself to write some stuff down from time to time I think it can be a good thing (both for me and the world (at least the internet)). 

###What will I read here ? Your poney stories ?
Quite frankly, no real defined idea right now. You can expect some stuff on Java, about Development, about humanity in development and maybe some conferences I attend or organize.

###I am already a fan, Will you update this frequently ? 
I'll try my best, I promise (especially if I already have a fan).
